#
# Gestalt is an annotation-based library that opens a plethora of
# possibilities to developers looking for a multi-platform
# and modern event handler solution.
#
# The library downloads on runtime (normally while the server
# is starting) to reduce needed effort from developers.
# Users can manually disable this behavior with a settings
# property.
#
# This is where the library is downloaded:
